# Common Lisp Script

Common Lisp Script provides isomorphism between browser side and server side to Common Lisp as javascript's node.js and Clojure's ClojureScript.

# To be achieved

- Isomorphism in Common Lisp between browser side and server side.
- Proper interbridging between Common Lisp and javascript.
- Separate compilation and dependency management.
- Integration management into HTML files.

# Scoping

Common Lisp Script targets the second of following considerable scopes.

- Abstraction including HTML and CSS, not only javascript.
- **Isomorphism in Common Lisp between browser side and server side.**
- Expressing javascript in S-expression (Parenscript).

# Based on

- Common Lisp Script will be based on [jscl](https://github.com/davazp/jscl), so its specification compliance depends on jscl.
